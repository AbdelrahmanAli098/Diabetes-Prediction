# Diabetes-Prediction
This project applies various machine learning techniques to predict whether an individual is likely to develop diabetes based on medical attributes. The process includes:

🔍 Exploratory Data Analysis with visual insights using Seaborn and Plotly

🧼 Data preprocessing and scaling

⚖️ Handling imbalanced classes with SMOTE

🤖 Model training with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, and Gradient Boosting

📊 Performance evaluation using ROC Curve, AUC, and confusion matrix

Technologies Used
Python (Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Plotly)

scikit-learn

imbalanced-learn (SMOTE)

Results
The best-performing model was evaluated based on its ability to balance precision and recall while achieving high ROC-AUC scores.
